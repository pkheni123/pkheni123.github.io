- Lab 6
> Lab 6 Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I am a fan of blackjack. Implementation of the game the way that was required was a little different. There was no "win" output. The program takes two cards, Ace(A), King(K), Queen(Q), or number cards, through the command line and adds the value of each together. While there is no random draw of cards, it implements the situation value of the Ace card. If a 2 is drawn and an Ace after(or vice versa) the Ace will be valued as  11 to add up to 13, where as if a 10 is drawn and an Ace after (or vice versa) then it would be valued as 1 so it cannot go over 21.
