- Lab 6 Part 2

> Lab 6 Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I am a fan of blackjack. Implementation of the game the way that was required was a little different. There was no "win" output. The program takes two cards, Ace(A), King(K), Queen(Q), or number cards, through the command line and adds the value of each together. While there is no random draw of cards, it implements the situation value of the Ace card. If a 2 is drawn and an Ace after(or vice versa) the Ace will be valued as  11 to add up to 13, where as if a 10 is drawn and an Ace after (or vice versa) then it would be valued as 1 so it cannot go over 21.

- Lab 8 Part 1 



 >The objective of this lab was to use the power of the terminal to gather user inputs and put them into a list to be used later. In this case the inputs were gathered from the user using the command line. These three inputs would then be put into a frame, a sort of "fill in the blank" as seen in the example where "a", "b" , and "c" are used. I liked this lab because of how simple it was, however it showed how multiple user inputs can be taken as strings and can be used for many, more complex, things, like being converted into integer values to then possibly create a calculator that can add all the numbers given no matter how many.

- Lab 8 Part 2 


 >In this lab we were tasked with using the command line to take from one to as many arguments(inputs) as the user requires. The program takes all the command line inputs and adds them together then takes the amount of inputs and divides the sum by that number to get the average of all of the inputs. I liked this lab because of how flexible it is. It is not limited by the amount of inputs it can take. It can take 2 or 42.
